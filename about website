If you want to test the webstie code, please download the compressed file first, because I put all of my files there...

We only achieved upload a image from front end to back end and save the image in upload file.
We used node.js to achieve back end and javascript(html and css) to achieve front end.

In order to try the effect of the website, you should have a environment to keep server.js working(webstorm for example) and visit 
127.0.0.1:3000 port to see our main page and try our upload image function(if success, the image will be stored in directory 'upload')
