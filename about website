If you want to test the webstie code, please download the compressed file first.

We only achieved upload a image from front end to back end and save the image in upload file.You can submit a jpg/jpeg/png which is less than
2mb. You could try this function by put all files in a environment that php file could execute, and use index.html to submit the image, if it
is successful, you could find the image in the file'2333'. 

We want to use php to achieve back end and javascript(html, css and web module) to achieve front end.

Our plan is to realize the function that could let user upload a image and get the information about this class of plant.

Next goal: Realize the interaction between training model(python) and return a message to front end.
